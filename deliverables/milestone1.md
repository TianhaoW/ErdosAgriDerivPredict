Dataset description: Daily closing prices of agricultural commodities on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (and other exchanges), including wheat, soy/soy components, corn/ethanol, sugar, and orange juice. Depending on availability and appropriateness, we may also use pricing data of other commodities like milk or pork bellies, export data from the USDA, world data like weather or major news events, and core financial data like interest rates and rates of inflation.

Problem to solve: Agricultural commodities are vital for human existence, but commodities prices are volatile, hard to predict, and sensitive to human affairs. We would like to use past pricing data to uncover correlations between closing prices of different agricultural commodities, and then use that same data, along with data from the wider world, to predict future commodities prices.
