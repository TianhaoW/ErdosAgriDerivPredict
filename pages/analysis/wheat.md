## Wheat Species and Their Market Significance

Wheat is one of the most important staple crops globally, and in the U.S., there are six classes of wheat, categorized by **kernel hardness**, **color**, and **planting season**:

### Major Wheat Species

| Wheat Type                | Key Characteristics                                                                |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Hard Red Winter (HRW)** | 	Bread flour, **largest production & export** (Great Plains)                       |
| **Hard Red Spring (HRS)** | 	High-protein, premium pricing (Northern Plains)                                   |
| **Soft Red Winter (SRW)** | 	Used in pastries, **most actively traded** in U.S. Future market (Eastern U.S.)   |
| **Soft White (SW)**       | 	Noodles & pastries, **high exports (Asia)** (Pacific Northwest)                   |
| **Hard White (HW)**       | 	Whole wheat products, small but **growing demand** (Limited production in KS, CO) |
| **Durum**                 | 	**Highest protein**, used for pasta (ND, MT, AZ)                                  |

To analyze the wheat future market, we will focus on the **SRW** wheat, since it is traded heavily on U.S. futures 
markets, and is the second-largest wheat class.

### Wheat Futures Price Trends (Historical Perspective)
- **SRW and HRW wheat futures exhibit similar price trends**, indicating strong correlation in their market movements.
- **A sharp price surge occurred in 2022**, primarily driven by the **Russia-Ukraine war**, which disrupted global 
  wheat supply chains.
- Another **significant spike in May 2024** resulted from a combination of **frost damage in key European 
  wheat-producing regions** and **drought conditions across North America**. For more details, see this

### Contango Market Structure
- The futures contracts with later expiration dates trade at higher prices than near-term contracts. This is usually 
  called a **contango market**.
- Contango typically occurs due to the following factors:
  1. **Storage Costs** - Longer holding periods increase storage expenses.
  2. **Financing Costs (Interest Rates)**
  3. **Insurance & Transportation Costs** - Longer storage requires insurance against spoilage, theft, or contamination.
  4. **Market Expectations** -  Anticipation of rising wheat prices can drive up futures prices for later contracts.

### Trading Volume Analysis
- **Seasonal patterns** are evident in trading volume, reflecting recurring market behavior. 
- **Declining volume as expiry nears** – Many traders reduce activity in expiring contracts, shifting focus to 
  later-dated futures instead of speculating on short-term price movements.
- **Pre-expiry volume surge** – As the expiry date approaches, traders must close positions to avoid physical delivery. 
  This leads to a temporary spike in trading volume before the last trading day.
