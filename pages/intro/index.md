## Future Contracts Overview
- **Definition**: A *futures contract* is a legally binding agreement to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined 
  price (*futures price*) on a specific date in the future (*expiry date*).  

- **Market Participants**:  
  - **Commodity Producers** (e.g., farmers) use futures contracts to hedge against potential losses if prices decline.  
  - **Commodity Users** (e.g., food manufacturers) buy futures contracts to protect against potential price increases.  
  - **Speculators** trade futures to profit from price fluctuations.  

- **Trading Conventions**:  
  - Futures prices are determined through *bidding and asking* on exchanges, where traders compete to buy or sell contracts.  
  - All transactions incur *exchange fees* and require an initial *margin deposit* to ensure contract fulfillment.  
  - The *exchange* acts as an intermediary, ensuring both parties meet their contractual obligations.  
  - Most actively traded futures contracts are *standardized* by the exchange to ensure liquidity and uniformity.

## Key Features of Futures Contracts
- **Obligation**: Both parties in a futures contract are obligated to fulfill the contract at 
  expiration.
- **Exchange Traded**: Futures contracts are typically traded on organized exchanges, such as the [CME Group](https://www.cmegroup.com), which 
  provide a transparent and regulated marketplace.
- **Standardization**: Futures contracts are standardized, meaning they have specific terms regarding the asset, 
  quantity, quality, settlement type, expiry date, delivery location, and etc.
- **Hedging**: Commodity users and producers use futures to hedge against price movement.
- **Leverage**: Traders can control a large contract value with a relatively small initial investment (margin).

## Types of Futures Contracts
Futures contracts come in various forms, but they generally fall into these key categories: **Stock Index Futures**, 
**Agricultural Futures**, **Energy Futures**, **Metal Futures**, **Currency Futures**. We introduce the first two as 
examples here.

### Stock Index Futures
These futures allow traders to speculate on the movement of a stock market index. They do not involve the physical 
delivery of assets but are settled in cash.
- **Examples:**
  - S&P 500 Futures (ES)
  - NASDAQ-100 Futures (NQ)
- **Trading Conventions:**
  - Typically **cash settled** daily, no physical asset delivery.
  - Contracts represent a fixed multiplier of the index value.
  - Used for hedging stock portfolios and speculating on market trends.

### Agricultural Commodity Futures
These futures involve contracts for the delivery of agricultural products at a future date.

- **Examples:**
  - Corn Futures (ZC)
  - Wheat Futures (ZW)
  - Soybean Futures (ZS)
- **Trading Conventions:**
  - Typically with actual delivery of the commodity.
  - Delivery occurs at designated warehouses if the contract is held until expiration.
  - The buyer of the contract is responsible for the warehouse storage fee and delivery cost.
  - Used by farmers, food producers, and speculators to hedge against price fluctuations.
